### Explanation

This visualization is a network analysis of all of the military colleges in the USA. Network visualizations are excellent for relationship models. This visualization, shows the similiarities between the school backgrounds. The rings are considered the nodes(headers) from the dataset. The lines connected are known as the edges. The animation is a minute long, displaying movement within the nodes and edges. The animation starts off as a star, then transition into a ring-wheel. Inside the ring-wheel are the edges, which forms different shapes each half a second. Stars, webs, alien heads, and a lion symbol are formed within the edges. The alien heads can be shown by one, or two at a time, and can be formed in different directions (Some can be shown upside down). Have to closely look into the edges, to see the movement and shape. The animation was used by the NDTV package in R.
